I am using Cloudera for running Sqoop so the instructions are related to that:

Download test_db from https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db using the "Clone or Download" option
unzip the downloaded file (test_db-master.zip)


Login to cloudera
cd to the unzipped folder

type  mysql -u root -pcloudera -t <employees.sql

you will see info about tables getting loaded, once the installation is complete, enter "show Databases;"

you should see "employees" database now. Enter "use employees" to select the employees Database

After that enter "show tables;" ==> this will list all the tables under employees database

Now you can use these tables to load into HDFS using SQOOP

I also loaded another database named sakila using the following commands

type  mysql -u root -pcloudera -t <sakila-mv-schema.sql
 followed by
type  mysql -u root -pcloudera -t <sakila-mv-data.sql
